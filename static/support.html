    <h1>Sanasolmu - Support</h1>
    <h2>Installation & gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      Once you've <a href="/slack/install">installed</a> the Sanasolmu bot into
      your Slack workspace, invite it to a channel. It's best to dedicate a
      channel for this, to limit the bot's access to any possibly confidential
      messages on other channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Sanasolmu has joined a channel, the following command becomes
      available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>!knot</code> &mdash; Starts a new round. Language and/or word
        length can be given as parameters, for example
        <code>!knot fi 4</code> would start the game with a finnish four letter
        word.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Commands are given by typing them into the channel.</p>
    <p>
      The bot will then reply with a jumbled word, for example: <code>T</code>
      <code>L</code> <code>O</code> <code>A</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guess the word the given letters belong to by typing your guess into the
      channel, e.g. <code>talo</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      If your guess was correct, you'll receive points and the bot will announce
      a new knot to untangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your guess was incorrect, but had the correct letters (and nothing
      more), the bot will acknowledge this with a reaction. You may try guessing
      again.
    </p>
